# Functie: python code tbv genereren van music
# Opmerking: deze code is gegenereerd obv ChatGPT3 obv de volgende 
#            vraag:
#                   give me python code to create music based on
#                   a AI transformer a Tensorflow API in a 
#                   Musescore output format trained based on midi files
#
# Bij deze code is de volgende informatie gegeven:
# In this code, you need to replace 'path_to_your_model' with the actual
# path to your trained AI transformer model file. You also need to provide
# the paths to the MIDI files you used for training in the midi_files list.
#
# The preprocess_midi() function represents the preprocessing steps required
# to convert a MIDI file into a sequence of tokens suitable for training the
# AI transformer model. This step might involve parsing the MIDI file,
# extracting musical features, and encoding them as tokens. You'll need to
# implement this function or use a library that provides this functionality.
#
# The musescore_api.convert_to_musescore() function is a hypothetical function
# that converts the generated sequence to Musescore format. You'll need to
# implement this function or use an existing library that provides this functionality.
#
# Remember to adjust the code according to your specific use case and the requirements
# of your AI transformer model, MIDI processing, and the Musescore API.

# ToDo:
# 1. Zie tekst implement functie preprocess_midi()
# 2. Zie tekst implement functie musescore_api.convert_to_musescore()
